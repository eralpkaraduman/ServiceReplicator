Service Replicator
==================

Small local node.js server which can be used to replicate remote web server endpoints for fast development purposes.

  - Run locally on where you develop your whatever client application
  - Create a server to be replicated
  - Enter service paths
  - Enter endpoint responses
  - Change your .hosts file or put dev args on your code to force app to use this server rather than the remote.
  - Tweak responses on the fly.
  - Tears of joy.
